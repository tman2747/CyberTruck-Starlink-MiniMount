## Printing Instructions

For the best results when printing this mount, please follow these guidelines:

- **Material:** Use ASA filament. ASA provides excellent UV resistance, making it ideal for outdoor use and ensuring durability in various weather conditions.
- **Infill:** Set your slicer to 40%-50% infill

## Assembly Instructions

To secure the mount to your Cybertruck, you will need:

- **Nuts:** Two 5mm Black lock tight nuts are required to attach the mount securely to the vehicle.
- **Starlink Pipe Adapter:** The mount is designed to be used with the Starlink pipe adapter that comes with the Starlink Mini when purchased. This adapter ensures a secure fit between the Starlink Mini and the mount.

## Important Safety Notice

**WARNING:** This mount is intended for use only when the Cybertruck is stationary. Do not drive the vehicle while the mount is equipped, as it could pose safety risks and is not designed to withstand the forces experienced during driving.
